/**
 * Design-resolution stage: scene code works in fixed DESIGN UNITS, and this
 * module maps them to real pixels — so anything sized at 1/4 of the design
 * width takes up 1/4 of the screen width on EVERY device and aspect ratio.
 *
 * How it works (width-fit, the pattern production RUN games use for all
 * gameplay layout):
 *   - The stage root container is scaled by screenWidth / DESIGN_WIDTH.
 *   - Horizontal space is therefore always exactly DESIGN_WIDTH units wide.
 *   - Vertical space varies with the device: designHeight() reports how many
 *     units tall the screen currently is (taller phones simply see more).
 *     Anchor vertical layout to top / bottom / center via designHeight() —
 *     never hardcode a bottom edge.
 *
 * With the 9:16 device-frame clamp in styles/app.css, designHeight() for a
 * DESIGN_WIDTH of 720 ranges from 1280 (9:16 exactly) to ~1560 (tall 19.5:9
 * phones). Design your layout to work across that range: keep must-see
 * content within the top 1280 units or bottom-anchor it.
 */

 * on modern phones). For a LANDSCAPE game, invert the pattern: fix a design
 * HEIGHT instead and scale by screenHeight / DESIGN_HEIGHT, letting width
 * vary — see layout() below.
