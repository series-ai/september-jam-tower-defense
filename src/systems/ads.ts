// Rewarded-ads core for RUN games: one chokepoint for every "watch an ad,
// get a bonus" placement, with a shared per-day watch cap, a no-ads-platform
// RunBucks fallback, and a no-ads-subscriber instant-grant path.
//
// The three-path grant flow (grantReward — the single entry point every
// bonus placement should call):
//   1. AD           — ads available on this platform: show a rewarded ad,
//                     grant on a true return, count toward the daily cap
//                     and the optional watch ladder.
//   2. SUBSCRIPTION — an active no-ads subscriber gets the reward INSTANTLY,
//                     no ad shown. Deliberately still counted as a real
//                     watch (cap + ladder), so a subscriber's economy is
//                     identical to a watcher's, minus the 30 seconds.
//   3. RUNBUCKS     — no-ads platform (capabilities.ads === false, e.g. a
//                     Steam channel): charge a small RunBucks price for the
//                     same bonus via iap.spendCurrency (host shows its own
//                     confirm dialog). EXEMPT from the daily cap — the
//                     player pays per grant, which is self-limiting — and
//                     by default does not advance the ladder; flip
//                     countFallbackAsWatch to change it.
//
// The daily cap is a game-wide budget shared by every placement, rolled
// over lazily at the trusted-clock local midnight (same "day" the
// daily-rewards calendar uses, so the word means one thing to the player).
//
// Capability detection is PERMISSIVE on unknown: an older SDK or unavailable
// environment is treated as "ads available" — only an explicit `false` from
// the host flips a placement to the RunBucks path. SDK 5.23+ mock mode reports
// ads available and completes a rewarded overlay with `true`; debugFakeAds is
// available when tests need to bypass that overlay.
//
// This module never imports the save, iap-shop, or subscription systems:
// state arrives via getState(), subscriber status and the fallback spend
// via optional injected functions.
