/**
 * Asset manifest — the single place that lists what gets loaded and when.
 * Files live in public/ (URLs are relative to the page, so 'images/x.png'
 * means public/images/x.png; works in dev and in the deployed subdirectory).
 *
 * Two tiers (the pattern production RUN games use):
 *   - 'critical'  — awaited during the loading screen. Everything the first
 *                   interactive screen needs: menu art, UI chrome, the sprites
 *                   visible in the first seconds of play.
 *   - 'deferred'  — fire-and-forget background load after boot. Sub-screen
 *                   art, late-game content, anything the player can't see yet.
 *
 * Keep 'critical' small: every asset here delays first interaction.
